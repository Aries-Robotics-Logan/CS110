# CS110
Some of the projects that I worked on during the Fall Semester of 2022 at BYU. All files were written in Python.
This is not a comprehensive list for what I did, but rather just some of the programs I had fun doing. 
The programs with more than 100 lines of code were my projects, while the shorter ones were just homework that I had. Shoutout to my professor Dr. Gordon
Bean for being such an awesome person to learn from. This class was really fun and tested me in many different ways.
